In 2019, she receives an invitation to an art exhibition from a person named Joseph, who turns out to be Woon-ho's younger brother, from whom she learns that Woon-ho died in some kind of an accident all those years ago. Joseph thanks Bo-ra for remembering Woon-ho and says that the happiest moments in Woon-ho's short life were spent in her company. As the film ends, Bo-ra views a video made by Woon-ho that depicts their time together.</p>
